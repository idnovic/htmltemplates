# Website-V3
##

This is the third iteration of my personal website, https://linuswillner.me.

The third re-design was done for two major reasons:

1. Code quality - I wanted to rid myself of the auto-generated HTML I made with JS, and instead use something proper like React.
2. Learning - I wanted to get acquainted with React and SASS to improve my frontend dev skills.
3. Home-grown design - I wanted to design this website myself from the ground up to make it truly personal.

I am still an abhorrent designer, but I'm confident this single-page application will at least be a little better than the previous mess.
